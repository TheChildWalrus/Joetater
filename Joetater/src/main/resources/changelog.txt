Joetater Changelog

Version 1.5:

+ Added a system to execute /tellraw commands (with colours, links, etc.) as login messages to players
+ Added a safe restart command, which kicks all non-operator players until the server can catch up with its workload, to avoid rollbacks and data loss

Version 1.4:

+ Added an IP logging feature to log players' IP addresses and match them against those of banned players

Version 1.3:

+ Added configurable ingame checking for certain items above certain thresholds in player inventories

Version 1.2:

+ Added a config option to set the maximum joetate size
* Default maximum joetate size is now 2000 blocks
This prevents accidents and misuse with overly large region sizes, since in such a case it would be very difficult to remove the unwanted region files.

Version 1.1:

+ Added the /jbiome command to set biome IDs

Version 1.0:

Released.
+ Added the /joetate command
